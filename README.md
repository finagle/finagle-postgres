This library provides [PostgreSQL][postgres] database support for
[Finagle][finagle]. It was originally developed by [Mairbek Khadikov][mairbek],
with subsequent work by [The Factory][thefactory],
[Vladimir Kostyukov][vkostyukov], and others. In early 2015 Twitter began using
the library, and this repository reflects the most recent changes (as of March
2015) from The Factory's fork together with changes from Twitter's internal fork
(including new [SSL support][ssl-support]).

The library is currently cross-built for Scala 2.10 and 2.11 using [SBT][sbt].
